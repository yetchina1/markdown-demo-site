> The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.

Tesla was born on the 10th of July 1856 in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia). Tesla died on the 7th of January 1943 at the age of 86 in New York City, United States.
