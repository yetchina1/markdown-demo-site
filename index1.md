**Nikola Tesla**

***
Nikola Tesla was an __inventor__, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and _futurist_ who is best known for his contributions to the design of the *modern 
`alternating current (AC) electricity supply system`.*  

---
Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. Over ~~288~~  300 patents.
The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.

___

> Tesla was born on the 10th of July 1856 in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia).
  Tesla died on the 7th of January 1943 at the age of 86 in New York City, United States.
